# S3 Direct Upload Demo using Spring

This is a demonstration of how to perform direct uploads to AWS's S3
service from a browser. It's mostly based upon the blog post "[Direct
Browser Uploading â€“ Amazon S3, CORS, FileAPI, XHR2 and Signed
PUTs](http://www.ioncannon.net/programming/1539/direct-browser-uploading-amazon-s3-cors-fileapi-xhr2-and-signed-puts/)",
with some Java inspiration from the
[EvaporateJS](https://github.com/TTLabs/EvaporateJS/blob/master/example/SigningExample.java)
repo.

The demos are as follows:

* [upload_only](upload_only/) - just uploading files to an S3 bucket.
* [video_transcode](video_transcode/) - upload to S3, then kick off an
  [Elastic Transcoder](https://aws.amazon.com/elastictranscoder/) job via
  [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

# Provisioning

For each demo there is a [Terraform]() configuration under
`src/main/terraform`. You can build the necessary infrastructure to run
each demo as follows.

1. Change into `src/main/terraform` under the demo directory.

2. Set the following environment variables:
  * `TF_VAR_AWS_SECRET_KEY`
  * `TF_VAR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY`

3. Configure the remaining AWS variables in
   `variables.tf`.

4. Run the following to check all is well:

    `terraform plan`

5. Apply the config:

    `terraform apply`

# Running a demo

1. Change into the demo directory

2. Edit `src/main/resources/application.properties` to set the appropriate
   values.

3. Run maven with `mvn`.

4. Navigate to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).
